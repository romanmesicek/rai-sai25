## 1. INTRODUCTION

The preparation of educational infrastructure for teaching sustainability and business responsibility in AI contexts requires careful consideration of both content delivery mechanisms and the implicit messages conveyed through chosen technologies. As organizations increasingly grapple with the environmental and ethical implications of AI deployment, educational programs must prepare students to navigate these challenges from business and sustainability perspectives (Schwartz et al., 2020).

This whitepaper describes the preparation of infrastructure for the RAI-SAI25 course ("Sustainability and AI for Green") at the University of Applied Sciences IMC Krems, scheduled to begin in one month. Specifically, this document focuses on the first half of the course, which addresses sustainability challenges and business responsibility in AI contexts. The infrastructure employs GitHub as a central platform for content delivery and anticipated student interaction, though actual deployment and student engagement remain future considerations.

The infrastructure design addresses three preparatory objectives:

1. **Content organization:** Structuring materials on sustainability challenges and business responsibility in AI
2. **Delivery mechanism:** Establishing automated systems for content distribution and updates
3. **Pedagogical alignment:** Ensuring infrastructure choices reflect sustainable and responsible practices

This document serves as a design record and implementation guide for educators considering similar approaches, while acknowledging that empirical validation awaits actual course delivery.

## 2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

### 2.1 Sustainability and Business Responsibility in AI Education

The integration of sustainability concepts with business responsibility in AI education responds to increasing corporate attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. Organizations require professionals who understand both the technical capabilities of AI and its broader implications for sustainable business practices (Lago et al., 2015). This necessitates educational approaches that connect environmental considerations with business decision-making frameworks.

### 2.2 Infrastructure as Pedagogy

The choice of educational infrastructure carries pedagogical implications. By selecting GitHub—a platform designed for collaborative, transparent development—the course infrastructure embodies principles of openness and accountability relevant to responsible business practices. This alignment between medium and message follows McLuhan's (1964) observation that the medium itself communicates beyond its content, though the effectiveness of this implicit teaching awaits empirical investigation.

### 2.3 Open Educational Resources in Business Education

The adoption of open educational resources (OER) in business and sustainability education aligns with UNESCO (2019) recommendations while modeling transparency principles essential to responsible business practices. Public repositories demonstrate accountability and enable stakeholder scrutiny—concepts central to corporate sustainability reporting and responsible AI governance.
