# Resources Directory

This directory contains additional course materials, links, and resources in Markdown format.

## How to Add Resources

1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Add a description comment at the top (optional but recommended)
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Push to the repository

The file will automatically be converted to a styled HTML page and appear on the course website.

## Example Format

```markdown
<!-- description: Brief description that appears on the index page. -->

# Your Resource Title

## Section 1

Content here...

## Section 2

```

## Naming Guidelines
