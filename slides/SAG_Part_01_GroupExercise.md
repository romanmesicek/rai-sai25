# Task 3: Connection Examples

<!-- _class: groupwork -->

**Example connection types to look for:**

- **Causal relationships**: Climate change → Biodiversity loss
- **Reinforcing loops**: Energy poverty → Health outcomes
- **Trade-offs**: Land conversion ↔ Food security
- **Co-benefits**: Renewable energy → Air quality improvement
- **Resource competition**: Freshwater ↔ Energy ↔ Food
- **Social-ecological links**: Income inequality → Environmental degradation
