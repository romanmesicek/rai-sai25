#  Preparation

## Key Questions for Solutions

1. **Scale Management**: How to capture efficiency without enabling overconsumption?
2. **Equity Integration**: How to ensure benefits reach those most in need?
3. **Lifecycle Thinking**: How to account for full system impacts?
4. **Governance Frameworks**: What policies prevent negative outcomes?

## Design Principles
- Absolute targets, not just efficiency metrics
- Accessibility requirements from inception
- Transparent impact measurement
- Democratic control of data and algorithms

**Remember**: Technology is neutral - deployment determines impact

<!-- _class: compact groupwork -->

# Design Sprint Structure

**Part A: Problem Analysis**
- Current state metrics
- Root causes
- Key affected groups
- One "killer fact" that justifies AI

**Part B: AI Solution**
- What it does (simple terms)
- Data requirements
- Implementation timeline
- Technical complexity level

**Part C: Impact Estimation**
- Environmental: Better or worse?
- Social: Who wins, who loses?
- Economic: Does it pay back?


---

# Solution Design Tips

**Keep It Simple:**
- You're not building the AI, you're proposing it
- "Black box" descriptions are fine
- Focus on outcomes, not algorithms

**Think in Patterns:**
- Prediction → "AI predicts X to prevent Y"
- Optimization → "AI finds best combination of..."
- Classification → "AI identifies/sorts..."
- Automation → "AI handles routine task of..."

**Quantify with Ranges:**
- "10-25% improvement"
- "€50-200k investment"
- "6-12 month payback"

**When stuck:** What would a human expert do? Can AI do it faster/better/cheaper?

# Impact Estimation: Environmental

## 🌍 Environmental Impact

**Rate with traffic lights:**

🔴 **Worse** = More energy than saves, increases emissions
🟡 **Neutral** = Efficiency gains offset by AI consumption  
🟢 **Better** = Clear net reduction in energy/emissions

**Quick check questions:**
- How much energy will the AI system use?
- How much energy/resources will it save?
- What's the net effect?

**Reference:** One server ≈ 100 laptops ≈ 5,000 kWh/year


---
<!-- _class: groupwork -->
# Impact Estimation: Social

## 👥 Social Impact

**Rate with traffic lights:**

🔴 **Negative** = Jobs lost > created, increases inequality
🟡 **Mixed** = Some win, some lose, unclear net effect
🟢 **Positive** = More opportunities, broader access, fair distribution

**Quick check questions:**
- Who benefits from this AI? 
- Who might be excluded or harmed?
- Does it reduce or increase inequality?

**Consider:** Jobs, digital access, skills needed, language barriers


---
<!-- _class: groupwork -->
# Impact Estimation: Economic

## 💰 Economic Viability

**Rate with traffic lights:**

🔴 **Poor** = Payback >3 years or never
🟡 **Acceptable** = Payback 1-3 years
🟢 **Strong** = Payback <1 year

**Quick check questions:**
- What's the total investment needed?
- What savings/revenue will it generate?
- How quickly does it pay back?

**Rule of thumb:** If payback > 2 years, need strong non-financial justification

# Phase 3: Ethical Evaluation
## 15 Minutes (Breakout Rooms)

Check your solution


---
<!-- _class: compact groupwork -->

# Three Ethical Tests


<div class="cols">
<div>

## 1. Necessity Test
**Is AI actually needed?**
- Could this be solved without AI?
- Is AI the simplest solution?
- What unique value does AI add?

## 2. Justice Analysis
**Who benefits, who bears costs?**
- Distribution of benefits
- Distribution of risks
- Power dynamics
- Voice in decisions

</div>

<div>

## 3. Governance Check
**Who controls what?**
- Data ownership
- Algorithm control
- Accountability mechanisms

</div>

</div>

# Red Flags to Watch For

**⚠️ Warning Signs:**

- ✓ Benefits concentrated → Costs dispersed
- ✓ Vulnerable groups bearing risks
- ✓ No opt-out mechanism
- ✓ Black box decision-making
- ✓ Data extraction without benefit sharing

**If you find red flags:**
Don't abandon solution - propose safeguards!


---

<!-- _class: chapter -->

# Phase 4: Presentations
## 15 Minutes (Main Room)

Share your solution


---
<!-- _class: groupwork -->

# Presentation Format

**2 Minutes Per Group - Strict!**

**30 seconds each for:**

1️⃣ **Problem**: The killer fact + Why AI?

2️⃣ **Solution**: What the AI does + Key impact number

3️⃣ **Sustainability**: Environmental/Social/Economic verdict

4️⃣ **Ethics**: Biggest risk + Mitigation


**Then:** 1 minute Q&A (choose one challenge from chat)


---

<!-- _class: chapter -->

# Phase 5: Synthesis
## 15 Minutes

Finding patterns


---
<!-- _class: compact groupwork -->

# Pattern Recognition

**Together we'll identify:**

## Success Patterns 🟢
What worked across multiple solutions?

## Challenge Patterns 🔴
What obstacles appeared repeatedly?

## Trade-off Patterns 🟡
Which tensions emerged consistently?

Use sticky notes in shared Miro space.

# Connecting to Course Frameworks

## Session 1: Planetary Boundaries
- Which solutions help stay within ecological ceiling?
- Which might push us further into overshoot?
- Where do we see rebound effects?

## Session 1: Social Foundation (Doughnut)
- Which solutions strengthen social foundations?
- Which might create new deprivations?
- Who is left behind?

## Session 2: Business Ethics & Responsibility
- Are we creating value or extracting it?
- Who is responsible when AI fails?
- What would ethical business practice look like here?

# Phase 6: Closing
## 5 Minutes

Reflection 



---
<!-- _class: groupwork -->

# Reflection

## Three Quick Questions:

1. **Which AI application would you champion in your organization?**

2. **Which AI application would you reject?**

3. **What's your key insight from today?**

Post responses in Miro reflection space.
