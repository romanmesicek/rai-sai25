# Corporate Social Responsibility

---

# Corporate Social Responsibility

The (direct) responsibility of corporations for the range of their impact on society

---

# What is a corporation?

- Corporation (= company, business, firm) are part of the economic system
- Primary goal is to provide goods and services
- Organized into departments
- Managers and employees work together to achieve its goals

---

# Can a corporation have social responsibilities?

- Only human beings have moral responsibility for their actions
- Corporations are not human beings
- Corporations consist of individuals that have moral responsibilities
- Corporations are set up as legal persons (juristic personality)
- The actions of corporations can be evaluated from moral perspective

---

# Can a corporation be morally responsible for its actions?

- Only human beings (can) act morally/make moral decisions – only human beings have moral responsibility
- Corporations are organized in a way that no individual feels responsible for the outcomes of the corporate conduct
- (Only) corporations (can) build structures in a way to act morally

---

# Why do corporations have social responsibilities?

**Traditional view of business responsibility - Maximize profits for shareholders**
- Within the 'rules of the game' – the law
- Because managers are agents of shareholders
- Managers obligation is a 'fiduciary' one
- Money that does not go to shareholders, is 'stolen' from them

**Problems with the traditional view**
- Assumes that owners have a unified interest
- Assumes a perfect correspondence with law and ethics/morality
- Some argue that property rights are not absolute
- Many stakeholders are severely affected/have much at stake in business decisions

- Encourages entrepreneurial and innovative business models (e.g., Ecopreneur)
- Recognizes various actors including companies, their stakeholders, consumers, and investors
- Introduces concepts like divestment (withdrawing from harmful investments) and greenwashing (superficial environmental claims)
