![bg right:40% contain](images/pt02_slide12_img1_313x295.png)

The phrase „the triple bottom line“ was first coined in 1994 by John Elkington. 

One is the traditional measure of corporate profit—the “bottom line” of the **„profit“** and loss account. The second is the bottom line of a company‘s **„people“** account—a measure in some shape or form of how socially responsible an organisation has been throughout its operations. The third is the bottom line of the company‘s **„planet”** account—a measure of how environmentally responsible it has been.
